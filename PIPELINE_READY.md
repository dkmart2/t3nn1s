# Tennis Pipeline - Ready for Full Run ✅

## Pre-Flight Check Results

All critical checks passed:
- ✅ Jeff data files present (135.4 MB of point sequences)
- ✅ All required Python modules installed
- ✅ API key configured
- ✅ parse_point function implemented (processes Jeff's shot sequences)
- ✅ Cache directories ready
- ✅ Checkpoint/resume mechanism in place

## Files Created for Testing & Running

### 1. **test_pipeline.py**
- Tests pipeline with small subset (50-500 matches)
- Validates data loading and processing
- Provides memory usage profiling
- Estimates runtime for full dataset

### 2. **tennis_pipeline_runner.py** ⭐ MAIN RUNNER
- Production-ready runner with checkpoint/resume
- Handles 120+ hour runs gracefully
- Saves progress every 5 minutes
- Can resume from interruption
- Monitors memory usage
- Provides ETA estimates

### 3. **validate_pipeline.py**
- Comprehensive validation suite
- Checks all data sources
- Verifies Jeff point parsing
- Tests API integration

### 4. **preflight_check.py**
- Quick sanity check (no data loading)
- Verifies environment setup
- Checks file presence

## How to Run

### Option 1: Test Run First (Recommended)
```bash
# Test with 100 matches (~5-10 minutes)
python test_pipeline.py --size 100

# Review results, then proceed to full run
```

### Option 2: Full Pipeline Run
```bash
# Foreground (can watch progress)
python tennis_pipeline_runner.py

# Background (recommended for 120+ hour run)
nohup python tennis_pipeline_runner.py > pipeline.log 2>&1 &

# Monitor progress from another terminal
python tennis_pipeline_runner.py --monitor
```

### Option 3: Direct Run (Original)
```bash
# Original command (no checkpoint/resume)
python tennis_updated.py

# Or in background
nohup python tennis_updated.py > pipeline_full.log 2>&1 &
```

## Key Features of Pipeline Runner

1. **Checkpoint System**
   - Saves state every 5 minutes
   - Can resume from any interruption
   - Stores in `/Users/danielkim/Desktop/data/cache/checkpoints/`

2. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Memory usage tracking
   - ETA calculation
   - Error logging

3. **Jeff Data Caching**
   - Caches Jeff's data after first load
   - Subsequent runs load from cache (30 seconds vs 2 minutes)

4. **Graceful Interruption**
   - Handles Ctrl+C properly
   - Saves checkpoint before exit
   - Can resume with `--resume` flag

## Expected Runtime

Based on data volume analysis:
- **Test run (100 matches)**: 5-10 minutes
- **Full dataset (~30k matches)**: 100-150 hours (4-6 days)
- **Memory usage**: Peak ~8-16 GB

## Monitoring During Run

```bash
# Check progress
python tennis_pipeline_runner.py --monitor

# Watch log file
tail -f pipeline.log

# Check system resources
htop  # or top

# Check checkpoint files
ls -la ~/Desktop/data/cache/checkpoints/
```

## If Run Gets Interrupted

```bash
# Simply resume from last checkpoint
python tennis_pipeline_runner.py --resume

# Progress will continue from where it left off
```

## Critical Notes

⚠️ **Jeff's Point Sequences**: The parse_point function IS implemented, which means the pipeline WILL process shot-by-shot sequences. This is good! According to CLAUDE.md, this should provide 20%+ improvement.

⚠️ **Long Runtime**: The 100-150 hour estimate is normal for processing 30k matches with comprehensive feature extraction. The checkpoint system ensures you won't lose progress.

⚠️ **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage. If it exceeds available RAM, consider processing in smaller batches.

## Next Steps After Pipeline Completes

Once the pipeline finishes, you'll have:
1. `historical_data.parquet` - Complete match dataset with all features
2. `jeff_data.pkl` - Cached Jeff statistics
3. `weighted_defaults.pkl` - Default values for missing data

These files will be used by `model.py` for training the prediction models.

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `pipeline.log` for error messages
2. Run `python preflight_check.py` to verify setup
3. Use `--resume` flag if interrupted
4. Monitor with `--monitor` flag

**Ready to start!** Use the test run first to verify everything works, then launch the full pipeline.
