## üöÄ Strategic Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Jeff Data Maximization (Highest ROI)
**Week 1-2**: Implement shot notation parsing
```python
def parse_jeff_notation(shot_sequence):
    """
    Parse '4f8b3f*' into:
    - serve_location: 4 (wide)  
    - shot_1: 'f' (forehand)
    - direction_1: '8' (crosscourt)
    - shot_2: 'b' (backhand)
    - direction_2: '3' (line)  
    - ending: '*' (winner)
    """
```

### Phase 2: API-Tennis Integration  
**Week 3-4**: Add comprehensive statistics and live data
```python
def extract_api_features(fixture):
    """
    Extract all 25+ statistical categories
    Point progression momentum indicators
    Pressure situation outcomes
    """
```

### Phase 3: Hybrid Feature Engineering
**Week 5-6**: Combine both data sources for maximum signal
```python
def create_hybrid_features(jeff_data, api_data):
    """
    Jeff: Shot-level patterns and serve placement
    API: Official stats and real-time updates
    Combined: Most comprehensive tennis dataset available
    """
```
